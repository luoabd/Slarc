          <h1>Dr. Feng Helps Philippine General Hospital on TAVI Case</h1>
          <p>
            <img src="/images/News/Dr. Feng.jpg">
            Dr. Feng Yuan, from West China Hospital, Sichuan University, was invited by Dr. Dee Wilfred From Philippine
            General Hospital in Manila, Philippine to collaborate on a challenging transcatheter aortic valve
            implantation (TAVI) procedure on September 25, 2019.

            The Philippine General Hospital (PGH) is a tertiary state-owned hospital administered and operated by the
            University of the Philippines. It is designated as the National University Hospital, and the largest
            government facility and referral center. It has 1,500 beds, and has an estimated of 4,000 employees to serve
            more than 600,000 patients annually. PGH has 19 clinical departments which, with their attached units, offer
            the best facilities for the delivery of comprehensive care for Filipinos seeking specialty and subspecialty
            care. The PGH, being the heart of the University's Health Sciences Campus, is the largest training hospital
            in the country.

            The patient was an 80-year-old male, referred to PGH for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Owing to his
            advanced age and poor renal function, surgical aortic valve replacement, an open-heart procedure performed
            under cardiopulmonary bypass, was deemed unsuitable after multidisciplinary team discussion. TAVI was
            considered the best treatment option. However, TAVI in this patient was also associated with significant
            technical challenges. It is well accepted that comprehensive imaging workup is of critical importance for
            pre-planning and intra-procedural guidance of TAVI. In this patient, however, CT images are of low quality
            because only limited contrast dose could be used during scan to avoid deterioration of renal function,
            making it rather difficult to assess aortic root anatomies. Fortunately, having an experience with more than
            600 TAVI cases, Dr. Feng Yuan was able to evaluate the feasibility and specific risk of TAVI by using
            multimodality imaging. The patient had a tricuspid aortic valve with moderate calcification, both of which
            were favorable characteristics for TAVI. However, Sinuses of Valsava were narrow and the position of
            coronaries were low, as shown by Echocardiography and angiography, indicating high risk for the dreadful
            complication of coronary obstruction. After careful assessment and discussion with Dr. Dee Wirfred’s team,
            Dr. Feng Yuan suggested to proceed with TAVI using a 23-mm Venus A-Valve.

            By selecting a small-size prosthetic valve and employing special implant techniques, Dr. Feng Yuan
            successfully helped the team to avoid coronary obstruction and other complications. Final angiogram showed
            that bilateral coronary arteries were patent and not affected, and the prosthetic valve was in an optimal
            position with only trivial periprosthetic valve leak. On postprocedural discussion, Dr. Dee Wilfred
            expressed his willingness of inviting Dr. Feng Yuan to continuously support the TAVI program at PGH in the
            future.

          <h1>China's Medical Team Completed First-Ever Urologic
            Laparoscopic Surgery in Mozambique</h1>
          <p>
            <img src="/images/News/First-Ever Urologic Laparoscopic Surgery.png">
            Recently, Associate Professor Jin Tao of the Urology Department and Associate Professor Chen Kelin of the
            Liver Surgery Department from West China Hospital, two members of the 22nd batch of China's medical team to
            Mozambique, completed successfully the first-ever urologic laparoscopic surgery in Mozambique.

            The patient was a young man from Inhambane, 480 kilometers from Maputo, Mozambique. A right kidney mass was
            found in a local hospital more than 10 years ago, but was not duly treated. More than one year ago, the mass
            gradually enlarged, and developed swelling pain at the right lumbar; then he was transferred to Maputo
            Central Hospital for diagnosis and treatment. CT showed a right renal cyst (12x375px), but could not exclude
            the possibility of tumors.

            Due to the lack of urolaparoscopia operational technology in Mozambique, the doctors with the Maputo Central
            Hospital recommended open surgery, which, however, features large operative wound, high risk and slow
            recovery. After reading the CT films carefully, Jin Tao, head of the medical team, suggested that
            laparoscopic minimally invasive surgery should be adopted to ensure smaller operative wound, quicker
            recovery and good effect. Meanwhile, the team prepared the operation scheme for possible tumor at the right
            kidney, which could not eliminate the possibility of converting to open surgery or even excision of the
            right kidney.

            Given that this was the first-ever urologic laparoscopic surgery in Mozambique, the hospital, its urinary
            surgery department and operating rooms attached great importance to it. Director Emilia of the Anesthesia
            Department and Chief Physician Qin Sulan of the medical team took charge of anesthesia; urology expert
            Amancio held the laparoscope, Associate Professor Chen Kelin assisted the operation, and Duan Yong of the
            medical team served as the interpreter. All surgeons of the Urology Department, experts from Cuba, head
            nurses, and heads of general surgery and publicity department of the hospital went to observe the operation.

            Despite of the lack of special operating table, narrow, blurred view of the laparoscope, and unsatisfactory
            pneumoperitoneal pressure, Associate Professor Jin Tao and Associate Professor Chen Kelin conducted the
            operation with an ultrasound knife donated by WCH, while explaining in detail the process of the operation
            from endoscopic perforation, exposure of view of the posterior peritoneum to related anatomical procedures.
            It took less than 30 minutes to successfully complete the right renal cyst resection.

            This was the first time for Maputo Hospital of Mozambique to introduce the advanced diagnosis and treatment
            mode of ambulatory surgery, for which the outpatient clinic completed relevant preoperative examinations so
            that the patient immediately accepted operation upon admission; in contrast, patients who needed to be
            hospitalized for half a month could be discharged on the first day after operation, thus greatly shortening
            the time of hospitalization and saving medical resources.

            Since there existed doubts about the operation due to lack of experience in the urologic laparoscopic
            surgery, Jintao, head of the medical team, gave a special lecture on “Skills in urologic laparoscopic
            surgery” and the concept of ambulatory surgery, thus greatly enhancing the confidence of local doctors and
            ensuring the smooth progress of the operation.

            The first-ever urologic laparoscopic surgery in Mozambique was completed with the concerted efforts of all
            medical team members. At the same time, the advanced concept of ambulatory surgery was promoted amongst
            local medical workers. The medical team was widely praised by leaders, doctors and patients of the Maputo
            Central Hospital.

          <h1>The 2019 Chinese Classical Show for
            International Students Staged in SCU</h1>
          <p>
            <img src="/images/News/Chinese Classical Show for International Students.png">
            Themed with reading ancient and modern classics, promoting the Chinese civilization, telling the Chinese
            stories and exhibiting the charm of Sichuan, the 2019 Chinese Classic Show for the International Students
            was held at SCU recently.

            International students from over ten colleges and universities in Sichuan put on dozens of exciting
            programs.

            SCU Vice President Yan Shijing addressed this event, noting that the Chinese culture has a long history of
            splendid glory, and the Chinese classics are the spiritual treasure of the Chinese nation and the mankind.
            With the implementation of the BRI, more and more international students study in China. By the end of 2018,
            3,851 international students from 103 countries had been enrolled in SCU. Many international graduates of
            SCU have made their own efforts in the integration of the Chinese civilization and world civilization as
            cultural messengers for the exchanges between China and the rest of the world, he stressed, expressing his
            hope that this event could provide an access to the international students in gaining more knowledge of the
            Chinese culture.

            In recent years, students from more than 100 countries come to study in Sichuan, making it an important
            destination for studying in western China. As international students acting as a bridge for promoting
            cultural exchanges between China and foreign countries, this event will set up a new platform for promoting
            Sichuan culture worldwide, and injecting a new vitality and impetus into the education of international
            students.

            The joyful song mix “We are together” kicked off the competition, which attracted international students
            from Ghana, Thailand, Malaysia and other countries to express their love for China and Sichuan via their own
            rhythmic national songs and dances.

            Zhu Ziqing’s essay “Hurry”, recited by students from Pakistan, Nigeria, and Nepal, expressed their cherished
            enthusiasm for studying in China.

            An ode “Maritime Silk Road”, chanted by three Malaysian students, signaled the support of the ASEAN
            countries’ students to the Belt and Road Initiative.

            “I love China and the Chinese culture. The ancient Chinese poems always give me strong strength, and guides
            me to meet challenges bravely,” said an Iranian student from SCU who used a sensational “Short Song Ballad”
            to express his love for Chinese traditional culture.

            These students also performed classic works reflecting the modern Chinese people’s unremitting struggle for
            the rise and revival of the nation.

            The event was successfully concluded in the musical poem “I Love You, China” performed by a few SCU
            teachers.
